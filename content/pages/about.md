Hi, and welcome to my website! I’m John, a career educator with over 14 years of experience teaching English in Japan who’s now transitioning into the tech field--a lifelong interest of mine that’s finally becoming my career focus.

My interest in technology began when I was young and includes fond memories of working with an Apple IIe in my elementary school library and my grandmother's Macintosh LC II.  In high school I learned some HTML and built a website for the Dragon Warrior game series, hosted on GeoCities.  I even asked for Microsoft FrontPage for Christmas one of those years.

Though I began studying computer science in college, I ultimately shifted to education.   Technology remained a personal hobby during my teaching career, but recently, I decided to combine my love for learning and tech by pursuing a career in the industry.

Originally from the United States, I’ve been living in Japan for the past 15 years where I’ve been teaching English at various junior high schools around central Nagano.  Living in Japan for this time has allowed me to experience and appreciate the local culture, with festivals being a particular favorite.  I take part as often as I can, whether as a spectator or participant.

## What I’m working on

What really sparked my recent dive into technology was a TrueNAS server I set up five years ago.  It began as a simple quest for more storage with a Raspberry Pi and an external hard drive, but quickly turned into a full homelab experience when I found a used SuperMicro server on Yahoo Auctions.  Now, it’s a collection of interconnected services that my family relies on daily.

I’ve also recently been very interested in Go programming, working on small projects here and there when I have time.  Recently I put one of those projects, [Jailhouse Roll Call](https://github.com/jwschman/jrc), on GitHub.  It’s just a simple tool for me to check on the status of the several jails running on that TrueNAS server.

Since summer 2024 I’ve been actively pursuing different certifications to build and demonstrate my skills.  So far, I’ve earned LFCS and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certifications and am currently working on others to continue growing in the field.
