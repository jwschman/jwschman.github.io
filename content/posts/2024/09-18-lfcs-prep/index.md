I've been studying for a while and I finally set the date to take the LFCS.  The test is scheduled for October 1 and I'm pretty sure I'm ready for it.  I've actually been ready for a month or so, but I'm motivated to get a good score.  I know the score doesn't matter, only passing or failing, but I want to prove to myself that I can do it.

So what are the resources that I used for studying?

## Udemy: KodeKloud - Linux Foundation Certified Systems Administrator - LFCS

It seems like courses on Udemy are almost always on sale for 90% off, and I got this for less than Â¥1500 when I decided to start making an effort to learn Linux.  The videos contain a lot of information, but the labs are where I found most of the value.  As I listened to the lectures I took notes in .md files that I referenced the original times I did the labs.  As I got more used to the information I needed to look at the notes less and less.  Probably the biggest thing that helped me remember the information was...

## Anki

After I made all my notes and did my labs for the day I added cards to an LFCS Anki deck that I made.  I installed Anki on both my PC that I watched the Udemy videos on and my phone.  That way I was able to always check the cards even when I wasn't at my computer.  The last time I used Anki was when I was making an effort to learn more Japanese, and it absolutely works.  Since I began using the flash cards my need to look at the notes I wrote disappeared.  If I were to recommend one thing that I did, it's make an Anki deck of what you're studying.  The videos and labs are just getting and using the information, but Anki is what actually helped me remember it all.  I guess they named it Anki for a reason.

## killer.sh practice test

Signing up for the LFCS allowed me access to the killer.sh practice LFCS test.  This was actually quite a step up from the KodeKloud labs and practice tests, but also more professionally made and presented.  There were also quite a few questions that I hadn't studied for directly.  But since I had the experience over the last few months working with Linux I was able to figure things out fairly well.  Lots of checking man pages for things that I wasn't aware of.  But in the end I got a high score on my first try.  After completing the exam and checking the answers I added about 150 new flash cards to my Anki deck.  The killer.sh page says that the test is intentionally more difficult than the actual LFCS, so I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the new cards I added won't be necessary, but I'd rather be over prepared.

---

That's where I am now.  I've passed the killer.sh practice test and completed the Udemy KodeKloud LFCS course.  Over the next two weeks before the test I'll likely watch a few videos again in the areas that I feel the most weak in, and I'll keep up on my flash cards.  In two weeks it'll be over and hopefully I'll have my LFCS certification.
