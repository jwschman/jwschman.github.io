![image](sadslime.jpeg)

He's such a cutie!

It does make sense that it should be in its own directory since it has files associated with it.  what if i change it to not index.md though?

what if I also do this?
![image2 NEW](../sadslime-base.jpeg)

ok so that would have worked ... but doing posts with my new script will allow me to keep the pictures in their separate directores along with the index.  Like I said before in several pages... I'm just figuring things out.  

This way is actually closer to how zola winds up building the site anyway (much closer) so I think I'm going to go with this new directory based structure.  It seems to be working out just fine.  Next stop... featured images.
