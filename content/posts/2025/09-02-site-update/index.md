It was a long time coming, but I finally changed this site to be more of a personal portfolio rather than just a blog.  I have a new landing page, new top navigation sections, and, most importantly, a projects page.  The projects page is still a little simple and needs more work, but I think it looks pretty good so far.

I've mentioned before that I'm not a frontend developer and have very little experience with CSS, so to make things easier for me I tried out GitHub Copilot for help with the styling.  Fortunately I had already done some work with the badges on my about page, and I was able to build off of those for the new landing and projects pages.  It really didn't take too much work to get close to what I wanted.  Tweaking things myself got me to where I am now.

I do have a few personal rules for how I use AI-generated materials.  

- First, I'll only use it for code, not content.  I want my words to be my own.
- Second, I also only use code that I can understand myself.  I want to feel comfortable with the code and know what it does when I use it.  This means the CSS I used is all very simple, but I know what everything does and how to use it.
- Third, I won't try to pass AI generated code as my own.  If something was written by an LLM, I feel the need to let people know what it is.

Really, that's it.  This post was mostly just a way for me to celebrate the refresh of the site and hopefully get back into the swing of writing for it.  I already have a lot of posts planned.
